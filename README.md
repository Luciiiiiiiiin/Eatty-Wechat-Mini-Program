This is a  repository storing the engineering file behind the "eatty" Wechat Mini Program

"Eatty" is a Wechat Mini Program designed to solve breakfast selection dilemma happened in the family. The problem is derived from a long-lasting issue happened in our captain - Lucien's family. Lucien's mother complained a lot on how to satisfy everyone when she made breakfast every morning. In the house, the parents are forbidden to intake food with too much fat and sugar due to diabetes and high blood pressure. However, as teenagers, Lucien and his little sister Ana always desired to have some junk food such as fries on the table. The conflict between two generations of food preference due to various flavor preferences and health conditions make Lucien's mom really struggle to make a ideal breakfast which everyone satisfies. Although seemingly it is impossible to satisfy everyone, our group is wondering whether we can design an algorithm to calculate the most ideal food selection based on the food preference and health condition of everyone in a family, and then recommend some dishes chosen from a huge dishes database.
